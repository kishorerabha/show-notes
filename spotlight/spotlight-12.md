- [Node.js API (NAPI)](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node) - Node with PoC ABI stable API for native modules. The goal of this project is to provide a stable Node API for native module developers. NAPI aims to provide ABI compatibility guarantees across different Node versions and also across different Node VMs â€“ allowing NAPI enabled native modules to just work across different versions and flavors of Node.js without recompilations.
